    <h1>Hummus Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../recipe-images/hummuspizza.jpg">
    <h2>Bon Voyage!</h2>
    <p><strong>Who doesn't love mac-n-cheese!</strong> Using this simple and easy to do recipe, you too can have a family classic for everyone to enjoy.
    I picked a recipe that includes cauliflower because it pairs extremely well with the <i>traditional</i> mac, as well as being a healthy food to eat.
This recipe is also super simple to follow and can be scaled to make more or less depending on your needs. </p>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
    <li>1 cup hummus spread</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups sliced bell peppers, any color</li>
    <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
   
</ul>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees C (220 degrees C).</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>
    Roll out pizza crust and place on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of hummus over the crust. Arrange sliced peppers and broccoli over the hummus, and top with shredded cheese.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>
    Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and cheese is melted in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
