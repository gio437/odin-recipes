    <h2>A Nutrious and Simple Mac-N-Cheese Recipe!</h2>
    <p><strong>Who doesn't love mac-n-cheese!</strong>Using this simple and easy to do recipe, you too can have a family classic for everyone to enjoy.
    I picked a recipe that includes cauliflower because it pairs extremely well with the <i>traditional</i> mac, as well as being a healthy food to eat.
This recipe is also super simple to follow and can be scaled to make more or less depending on your needs. </p>
